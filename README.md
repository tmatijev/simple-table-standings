const standings = simpleTableStandings(teamsMatches);
```

### Input Type

```typescript
type Match = {
  isHomeMatch: boolean;
  goalsFor: number;
  goalsAgainst: number;
};

type Team = {
  name: string;
  matches: {
    [opponent: string]: Match[];
  };
};
```

### Output Type

```typescript
type ExtendedTeam = Team & {
  points: number;
  goalsFor: number;
  goalsAgainst: number;
  goalDiff: number;
  records?: {
    [opponent: string]: {
      points: number;
      goals: number;
    };
  };
};
```

### Example Output

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Hajduk",
    "points": 8,
    "goalsFor": 8,
    "goalsAgainst": 8,
    "goalDiff": 0,
    "records": {
      "dinamo": { "points": 2, "goals": 3 },
      "rijeka": { "points": -1, "goals": -3 }
    }
  }
  // ... more teams
]
```

## Rules

- Win: 3 points
- Draw: 1 point
- Loss: 0 points

Teams are sorted by (in order of priority):
1. Total points
2. Head-to-head matches (points earned in matches between tied teams)
3. Overall goal difference
4. Total goals scored

For example, if two teams have the same points:
- First, compare their head-to-head matches
- If still tied, compare their goal differences
- If still tied, compare total goals scored
